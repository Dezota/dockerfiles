# GateOne Docker Image

This is a docker image for the [GateOne](https://github.com/liftoff/GateOne) HTML5 web-based terminal emulator and SSH client.  The offical automated [build](https://hub.docker.com/r/liftoff/gateone/) on Docker Hub no longer works do to some mismatched Python dependencies. This image corrects these errors.

#### Build Yourself
```
git clone https://github.com/Dezota/dockerfiles.git
cd gateone
make build
make run
```
